        What's the difference? <br> Why are you scrambling up a mountain getting struck by lightning while other people simply fly a helicopter to the top?

        <p>Are they cheating? Some are. <br>
            Were they born to win? Some might say that. <br>
            Are you screwed? Yes, we are all going to die. <br>
            But if you can find your vocation, your calling in life, then all the darkness in the world won't be enough to stop you.

        <p>The bottom line is that automation is accelerating. If you can use it, it can help you prosper.
        If you can't, it can ruin you. And in all the chaos caused by automation, it can feel overwhelming.

        <p>It weakens us to be confused about the world today. I hate that. 
            So I want to give you 3 things that I've spent over 100 hours preparing for you.
            1. A full explanation of what automation means for you and what you should do about it
            2. A comprehensive map of the paths you can take starting today to find your vocation which will bring wealth, joy, and meaning into your life.
            3. A 30-minute or so 1-on-1 consulation to get you started on your personalized path.

        <p>We are in a hyper-marketized world so it's natural for you to wonder how much I want to charge you for these items. They are 100% free for now. I think this problem is extremely serious and I want to help people. (Also, I already have a day job!)
        If things go well and enough people find this helpful, then one day I might charge something nominal like $1/month, and probably bring on other people who care about this issue to help with coaching.
